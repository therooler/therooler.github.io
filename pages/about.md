# **About Me**

I studied theoretical physics at Radboud University. Also, I was part of a frictionless data-driven cloud platform start-up that uses
growth hacking business intelligence experts to help transition companies to the 17th century.

If all goes well, I will start my PhD in 2020 at <TBD>. There I will try to calculate things like

- $\sum_i^4 \text{quantity}_i \|\psi_i\rangle $
- $\prod_{i}^\infty \frac{(\text{stuff})^i}{\text{things}}$

Which will be exciting!
