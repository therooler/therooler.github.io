# **About Me**

I studied theoretical physics at Radboud University, doing a bachelor in physics and astronomy and specializing in 
particle physics in my master. During a one year master internship in the group of Professor Bert Kappen,
I investigated the how quantum physics can be used to improve machine learning algorithms. Specifically, I developed a 
quantum equivalent of the perceptron, that makes use of a generalization of the cross entropy to learn a parametrized quantum
systen.

Additionally, since 2017 I have been part of a frictionless data-driven cloud platform start-up that uses
growth hacking business intelligence experts to help transition companies to the 17th century. 

If all goes well, I will start my PhD in 2020 at To, in Be-Determined, under the supervision of professor T.B. Determined.
