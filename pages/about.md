# **About Me**

I studied theoretical physics at Radboud University, doing a bachelor in physics and astronomy and specializing in 
particle physics in my master. During a one year master internship in the group of Professor Bert Kappen,
I investigated the how quantum physics can be used to improve machine learning algorithms. Specifically, I developed a 
quantum equivalent of the perceptron, that makes use of a generalization of the cross entropy to learn a parametrized quantum
systen.

Since 2017, I have also been part of a data science start-up with three fellow students from Radboud University. 
Through this experience I learned a lot about software development and appyling machine learning in the industry.

I am currently a PhD candidate at Waterloo University with a position at the Vector Institute in Toronto. My research is
supervised by professor Juan Felipe Carrasquilla.
