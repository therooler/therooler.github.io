## Tensorflow-qc

From Oktober 2019 until now, I have worked on my own Quantum Computing simulator in Tensorflow. The main reason for this project is that
the current frameworks (Cirq, Qiskit, Rigetti, Pennylane), do not support the GPU, so I thought I would change that. Tensorflow-qc allows one to do high performance simulations of quantum circuits, and combine these circuits with state-of-the-art Deep learning techniques. 

See the [Github page](https://github.com/therooler/tensorflow-qc) for more information.
